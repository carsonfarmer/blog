Here, the idea is not let the &amp;#8216;data speak for themselves&amp;#8217; but rather tell an engaging and intelligent story &amp;#8216;with data&amp;#8217;. Basically, we need to move &lt;em&gt;beyond&lt;/em&gt; counting things in order to really understand&amp;nbsp;anything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I agree with pretty much everything Susan says, and her use of a very personal example really deepens the impact of her talk. I really liked her focus on the need for &amp;#8216;deepening our critical thinking skills&amp;#8217;, and I think this is something we need to ensure we are passing on to our students as well. Putting less focus on what the &lt;em&gt;data&lt;/em&gt; say, and more focus on what we can learn &lt;em&gt;with&lt;/em&gt; the data is something we should be teaching more at the undergraduate, graduate, and even high-school levels. I think in general, the statistics literature and curriculum are better at this perspective than their machine learning counterparts (although statistics curruculum [my own included] aren&amp;#8217;t always at the cutting-edge of modern teaching methods either). But this need not be the case, and I hope as we continue to generate, collect, store, and analyze more and more data, we keep in mind the &lt;a href="http://www.wired.com/2013/04/with-big-data-context-is-a-big-issue/"&gt;need for context&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">cfarmer</dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 28 Oct 2014 14:33:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>tag:www.carsonfarmer.com,2014-10-28:2014/10/what-to-do-with-all-this-data/</guid><category>Video</category><category>Internet</category><category>Big Data</category></item></channel></rss>
