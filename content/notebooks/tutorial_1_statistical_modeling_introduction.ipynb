      "Introducing a series of tutorials on using Python for introductory statistical analysis based on the 'Computational Technique' sections of each chapter from ['Statistical Modeling: A Fresh Approach (2nd Edition)'][book]. The goal of this series of tutorials is to show how all of the R analysis and commands used in the book can be done just as easily using the [Python][python] programming language. This has the dual goal of introducing 'Scientific Python' to students learning statistics, as well as showcasing the recent advances in statistical computing that have been introduced to Python in recent years. Each tutorial in the series will cover the Computational Technique section of a different chapter from the book, starting with Section 1.4.3 from the introduction (which technically *isn't* a Computational Technique section, but is a useful introduction none-the-less), which is [available online here][first-chapters]. Note that many of these tutorials will require you to have read the corresponding chapter(s) from the book in order to be useful.\n",

      "All the tutorials assume that Python is installed and running on your computer. To use the notebooks [associated with these tutorials][notebook-link], you'll also need to have [IPython][ipython] (with notebook) installed. There are plenty of resources online with information on [IPython][ipython], [Notebooks][ipython-notebook], and [installation instructions][ipython-install]) for both. You'll also need to have the [Scientific Python][scipy] libraries installed for additional statistical functionality (we'll also introduce some [other statistical libraries][statsmodels] in later tutorials), and [matplotlib][] for plotting and visualization.\n",

      "\n",
      "Once you have IPython installed, you are ready to perform all sorts of statistical and other mathematical and scientific operations. However, to use the powerful range of tools, functions, commands, and statistical methods available in Python, you first need to learn a little bit about the syntax and meaning of Python commands. Once you have learned this, operations become simple to perform. Before staring this tutorial, read section 1.4 from 'Statistical Modeling: A Fresh Approach', which outlines some general concepts surrounding computational statistics (in the context of R). In particular, it provides some explanation of a 'language-based approach' to statistical computing - which is an important concept throughout the book and this series of tutorials."

There are many different words used to refer to the \"what\": a procedure, a task, a function, a routine, and so on. Like in the book, I'll use the word **computation**. Admittedly, this is a bit circular, but it is easy to remember: computers perform computations.\n",
