This also makes it possible to perform many di\ufb00erent analyses of the data; modelers often create and compare many di\ufb00erent models of the same data."

These vary depending on how the data are stored, where they are located, etc. To help keep things as simple as possible, the 'pandas' Python library iprovides an operator, `read_csv()` that allows you to access data \ufb01les in tabular format on your computer as well as data stored in repositories such as the one associated with the 'Statistical Modeling: A Fresh Approach' book, or one that a course instructor might set up for his or her students.\n",
