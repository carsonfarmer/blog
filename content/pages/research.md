### <i class="fa fa-clock-o"></i> Background

[![Background][image0]{.right}][link0]

I completed a BSc (honours with distinction) in Geography at the
University of Victoria, in British Columbia, Canada in 2006. There, my
studies focused on GIS, spatial statistics, and housing prices, and led
directly to a fully funded MSc the following September. During my MSc
studies, I was awarded the Derrick Sewell Graduate Research Scholarship
in both 2006 and 2007, as well as two paper presentation awards at
national conferences in Ottawa and Saskatoon. My MSc research focused on
spatial-temporal aspects of snow cover and water content, and
spatial-temporal analysis methods in general. Prior to completing my MSc
dissertation in the summer of 2008, I was successful in obtaining PhD
fellowships from the Irish Social Sciences Platform (ISSP) and the
Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council (SSHRC) of Canada. I
completed my PhD in September 2011, under the supervision of Prof. A.
Stewart Fotheringham. My dissertation was entitled "Commuting flows &
local labour markets: Spatial interaction modelling of travel-to-work".

[![Current & Future Research][image1]{.left}][link1]

My current and future research interests are ultimately concerned with
modelling and understanding spatial processes. While much of the current
work on modelling urban dynamics is concerned with networks and abstract
representations of space, I also see the city as a sociological system
made up of individuals who often behave in unexpected or inventive
ways. In this vein, I am as much interested in *theories* of
interactions, cities, and human dynamics as I am in the *methods* and
*models* designed to characterize them. As part of my long-term research
goals, I continue to incorporate theories of spatial interaction,
urban geography, and GIScience into my work on complex urban systems and
dynamics. Examples of the types of questions I am interested in
answering include "how does the spatial structure and temporal
dynamics of cities and regions contribute to the spatial-temporal
patterns of various urban processes, such as housing prices and
development, labour markets, and human mobility?" and "how does our
understanding of aggregate movements within urban environments help
us to understand the behaviour of individuals, and how can we
effectively integrate human and urban processes at multiple scales?".

My primary interest is in flow and movement data associated with
underlying networks within urban environments, be they infrastructural,
social, spatial, or a combination of all three. Spatial models are my
primary means of quantitatively characterizing urban processes, and are
used to explore data at a range of spatial and temporal resolutions. I
also have a keen interest in developing new approaches to solving
geographical problems by fostering expanded use of ideas and methods
from outside geography and GIScience. In particular, I aim to promote
the use of spatial analysis methods and data-driven research to help
explore the complex hierarchies and interactions within urban
environments.

*Commuting flows & local labour markets: Spatial interaction modeling of travel-to-work*

[![PhD Research][image2]{.right}][link2]
One of the most promising approaches to mitigating land-use and
transportation problems is continued research on urban commuting.
Commuting is essential to many individuals, allowing them to participate
in the labour market and earn a living to meet their essential needs. As
such, a better understanding of the determinants of commuting will
ultimately lead to a better understanding of the complexities of
employment, housing, and the many spatial processes underlying
commuting. However, in order to understand the commuting process, it is
important to examine the milieu within which commuting takes place: the
local labour market (LLM). In my PhD research, the interplay between
commuting and LLMs is explored through the use of regionalization
techniques and spatial interaction models. I try to show that LLM
characteristics play a significant role in intra-regional commuting
patterns and that a failure to account for LLM conditions may seriously
hinder the applicability of models of commuting. Specifically, I suggest
that there are many different LLMs across Ireland and that these LLMs
characterize the commuting patterns of population sub-groups. By
incorporating these LLMs into models of commuting, I show that in
addition to distance and working population size, the spatial structure
of origins and destinations and a number of non-spatial attributes such
as unemployment, housing density, and education, all significantly
affect commuting flows. Furthermore, the distance decay component of
these models can be shown to capture a combination of geographical
distance and regional differentiation due to LLM boundaries, leading to
'functional' distance decay. This concept of functional distance decay
is a key finding of my research, and, indicates that in addition to the
configuration of origins and destinations, distance decay is also
dependent on the spatial structure of LLMs, or more generally, the
totality of surrounding conditions within which spatial interaction
takes place. This research is funded in part by the ISSP, StratAG, and
SSHRC, and is being completed under the supervision of Prof. Stewart
Fotheringham.

*Spatial time-series analysis of satellite derived snow water equivalence*

[![MSc Research][image3]{.left}][link3]
My MSc research focused primarily on examining the spatial-temporal
characteristics of snow water equivalence (SWE) in Canada, and comparing
these characteristics to known or hypothesized climate and ecological
processes. The spatial and temporal distribution of terrestrial snow
cover has implications for many ecological processes, such as local
snowmelt release, local and global atmospheric circulation, as well as
climate, and hydrological cycles. The sensitivity of terrestrial snow
cover and SWE to atmospheric conditions and overlying air temperatures
also makes snow cover a useful indicator of climate change. Thus,
examining the spatial distribution of terrestrial snow cover and SWE
over time aides in understanding current and future trends in changing
climate conditions. Our research links the spatial-temporal interactions
of SWE to underlying land-cover characteristics, as well as generates
relevant temporal characteristics from SWE time-seriesâ€™ in order to
explain the dominant SWE regimes across Canada. In addition to its broad
implications for climate change research in general, this research also
has implications for use in a national biodiversity monitory system for
Canada, driven by remote sensing of multiple indicators of biodiversity.
These indicators include productivity, disturbance, topography, and
land-cover, of which terrestrial snow cover and SWE play an integral
part.
