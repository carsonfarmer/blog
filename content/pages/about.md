My research interests span a wide range of topics in urban and regional
analysis, with a focus on spatial-temporal dynamics, complexity, and
spatial interaction. My previous PhD research examined the impact of
commuting flows on the formation of local labour markets, and
highlighted the necessity of considering commuting within the context of
local labour market spatial structure. My current and future research
interests fall under the general banner of "complexity in urban
systems" and encompass interdisciplinary research into topics such as
emergence and the multi-scale nature of commuting, the dynamics of
housing markets, transportation modelling, as well as more social
concepts, such as visible expressions of homelessness and local labour
markets. I am particularly interested in movements and flows of
individuals, information, and commodities within urban environments, as
well as the development and implementation of novel spatial analysis
methods and software aimed at characterizing these flows.
