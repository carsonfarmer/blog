My research tends to fall under the general banner of <b>computational GIScience</b> and encompasses work on networks, transportation, big data, snow/water processes, and geospatial algorithms. Beginning Fall 2015, I will be Assistant Professor in the Geography Department of the University of Colorado at Boulder where I will focus on spatial-temporal analysis and data-intensive modeling of dynamic geographical processes. I am a strong advocate for open source software and open data, and I enjoy cycling, snowboarding, and collecting robots.

If you'd like to get in touch, please [contact me][link].
