I have recently joined the [editorial team][editors] at [Spatial Demography][spatial-demography]
-- a new journal outlet for demographers and others who use spatial data, 
methods, and theory. 

A bit more [about the journal][about]:
> Spatial Demography [ISSN: 2164-7070 (online)] focuses on the spatial analysis 
> of demographic processes. This cross-disciplinary work involves modern 
> demographic data visualization, enhanced geo-referenced data availability, and 
> spatial statistics, facilitated through full color graphics, motion video 
> tools, and a quick time-to-publication. The journal publishes research 
> articles, essays, research reports, data sources, computing software, teaching 
> notes, and book reviews on a wide range of topics of interest to the social 
> demographer.

Spatial Demography is more than just another new online journal - the editors 
strongly promote the use of the [forums][forums] as a place to engage with others on 
general research topics, as well as discuss specific articles from the journal 
and [Online First][online-first] area. One of the really nice thing about the forums 
is that they have a familiar 'blog-feel', where users are encourage to post 
their thoughts about the work being done by others as well as their own work. 

Another thing I really like about Spatial Demography is that the Associate 
Editors embrace technology and sharing of ideas in a very open way. For example, 
Corey Sparks does a cool column/forum for the journal on ['Software and Code'][software-code]:
> The purpose of this forum is to highlight the tools of the trade, our 
> methodological toolbox, if you will.  With so many scientists in so many 
> disciplines contributing to the area known as "Spatial Demography", we all 
> have our old stand by routines, our tricks and our tips for new researchers.

The 'Software and Code' forum will routinely feature 'how-to guides' for various 
spatial analysis techniques using primarily open source computing applications, 
with lots of annotated code to help others learn everything from the basics to 
the more advanced spatial statistics methods.

A big thanks to Frank Howell and Jeremy Porter (Editors-in-Chief) for inviting 
me on-board. I'm excited to see where this journal goes, and I hope *you'll* 
check it out as well.
