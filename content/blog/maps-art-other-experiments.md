With the recent (and long anticipated) release of [Quantum GIS 2.0][qgis], 
there has been a lot of 'buzz' in the open source geospatial community about 
all the cool new features that QGIS now boasts, and how far it has come in such 
a short time. I was recently inspired by [such a post by Anita Graser (aka 
Underdark)][labels] (who is a wonderfully talented cartographer/designer) on 
data driven labeling in QGIS, so I thought I'd throw something together on a 
gray Friday afternoon to test it out. I also wanted an excuse to play around 
with [Reveal.js][reveal] slides in [IPython notebook][ipython], so I produced 
the following [slide show][slideshow] using the images from QGIS and some 
IPython magic:
