## Abstract

[![image1][oceans-small]{.right}][oceans]

The World’s oceans are a frontline for sustainability, given the expansion of 
human activity in coasts and seas, changes brought about by human forcing 
factors, and changes in the global ocean-atmosphere system.  Making an 
assessment of the extent and significance of change is a challenge for science, 
given the relative paucity of data and the multiple variables involved.  This 
paper reports on a study to empirically tests notions of 'industrialisation' and 
'colonisation' in the oceans for the first time. The approach draws on a key 
global spatial dataset developed by Halpern et al (2008). The methods include 
the combined use of Raster and R to overcome methodological challenges in 
analysing large spatial datasets which map the footprint of human activity in 
the world's oceans. The findings show that human activity in the oceans has 
increased by multiple factors in the most recent long term wave of economic 
development and show distinct spatial patterns of development.  Further 
refinement of this assessment is required and is likely to be driven by a 
recently established UN Global Assessment of the State of the Marine 
Environment.
