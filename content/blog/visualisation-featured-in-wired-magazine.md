A few weeks back the [CGI][] and I were approached by [Miguel Nacenta][]
from [SACHI][] about putting together an infographic for an article on
[FatFonts][] (also see my [previous article][]) to be featured on the
[Wired (UK) magazine][] website. Since Wired is one of my favourite
magazines, I jumped at the chance! Using data that [Dr Timothy
Stojanovic][] and I are working with as part of Timâ€™s work linking
off-shore cumulative human impacts to on-shore terrestrial urbanization,
I put together several infographics depicting human impacts on the
oceans surrounding Edinburgh and London. One of these graphics was
selected for the article, which is now [available online][]. So go check
out the article, and click on "View Gallery" to check out my
infographic, along with several cool images from [Miguel Nacenta][1],
[Uta Hinrichs][], and [Sheelagh Carpendale][]!

The infographic in the article doesn't have a title or legend per se, so
I'm going to create an amended version soon with an explanation of what
the values represent, and a bit of context to the data and what we are
hoping to show with it. So stayed tuned for updates!
