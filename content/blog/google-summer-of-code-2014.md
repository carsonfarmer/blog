The decisions for [Google Summer of Code 2014][gsoc] have been made, and I’ll be mentoring [Rahul Raja][rahul] from India. He will be working on the [enviroCar][envirocar] app UX design. Right next door, Carsten Keßler (who has [already posted an annoucement][carsten]) will be mentoring [Tao Lin][tao] from China, who will be working on the [Linked Data][linked-data] service provided by enviroCar.

We are both looking forward to working with the students and with the folks at 52°North, who are also mentoring 3 more students in [other projects][other]:

> 52°North is pleased to welcome the following students to work with us closely this summer on five Google Summer of Code projects!
> 
> * Sensor Data Access for Rasdaman, Simona Badoiu (Romania)
> * Using the ILWIS framework for geo-data capture with a mobile application, Bouke Pieter Ottow (Netherlands)
> * Proposal for Access Control User Interface for SOS Servers, Dushyant Sabharwal (India)
> * enviroCar App UX Design, Rahul Raja (India)
> * The Improvements of enviroCar Linked Data Service, Tao Lin (China)
> 
> The community bonding period has just begun. During this time, students get to know their mentors, read documentation and get up to speed to begin work on their projects. Programming will start mid-June. We really look forward to working with them on these exciting projects! Expect a few blog posts by every student and find out more [about the projects in the wiki][more-info].
> 
> The Google Summer of Code program received a total of 6,313 proposals from 4,420 students for 190 mentoring organizations and **1,307 students** were accepted ([source][source]). 52°North received 18 proposal submissions (2013: 17). We at 52°North are extremely happy to have gotten **5 slots** and have matched them with promising students (from four countries across two continents!) and capable mentors to work on challenging projects in the enviroCar, Sensor Web and ILWIS communities. A special welcome goes to the new mentors and communities that participate in the summer of code for the first time, and the Rasdaman community who we are collaborating with in one project.
