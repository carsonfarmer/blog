The decisions for [Google Summer of Code 2014][gsoc] have been made, and I’ll be mentoring [Rahul Raja][rahul] from India. He will be working on the [enviroCar][envirocar] app UX design. Right next door, Carsten Keßler (who has [already posted an annoucement][carsten]) will be mentoring [Tao Lin][tao] from China, who will be working on the [Linked Data][linked-data] service provided by enviroCar.

We are both looking forward to working with the students and with the folks at 52°North, who are also mentoring 3 more students in [other projects][other]:

* Sensor Data Access for Rasdaman, Simona Badoiu (Romania)
* Using the ILWIS framework for geo-data capture with a mobile application, Bouke Pieter Ottow (Netherlands)
