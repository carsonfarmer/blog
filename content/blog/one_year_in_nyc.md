One year ago today, January 3rd 2014, [my wife][amanda] and I officially moved to New York City. It has flown by extremely fast for both of us, but we've managed to enjoy the city and all of the benefits that come with it. Some highlights (in no particular order) include:

* Starting my own research agenda
* Skating at Rockefeller Center
* Seeing Chicago on Broadway
* Wondering through Manhattan at Christmas time
* Road-trip to Boston
* Living in North America again (Europe was wonderful, but its nice to be closer to family)
* Trip up to Montreal
* Seeing The Nance on Broadway
* Staff passes to Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade
* Meeting new friends and colleagues
* Seeing the Rockettes at Radio City Music Hall
* Teaching full courses for the first time
* Getting my first keynote speaker invite
* Wedding 2.0
* Getting *two* Thanksgivings
* NYC parades (Pride, St Patrick's, Thanksgiving)
* Movie date-nights in Bryant Park
* Amazing skyline views from our rooftop
* Entertaining friends and family
* Ordering pretty much anything I could possibly want on-line
* Taking the Subway every day (Sometimes that sucks...)
* Getting a new dog
* Having my own office :-)
* Celebrating New Year's Eve only blocks from Times Square
* Walking the High Line
* Seeing the New York Philharmonic in Central Park (With fireworks!)
* Having access to so many world class restaurants all the time
* Street vendors (Street meat)
* Turning 30
* Extreme temperatures
* And many more things, too numerous to list!

Here's to the next year, may it be even more fun and exciting than the last.
