**FREE AND OPEN SOURCE GIS** â€“ **August 4th to 8th, 2014**

The [Department of Geography][geog] at [Hunter College][hunter] of the [City University of New York][cuny] and [Hunter Continuing Education][cont] are offering a five day professional course in **Free and Open Source GIS** from **August 4th to 8th, 2014**. This five day course will span the entire range of GIS data capture, management, analysis, and visualization of geographic information using Free and Open Source Software (FOSS). These different elements of the GIS workflow will be discussed over the first four days and will then be applied in a final project completed on Friday. The course will combine lectures with hands-on sessions where participants will work with different free and open source GIS packages. Since we expect participants from many different organizations in the tri-state area, this training course also presents an excellent networking opportunity.

The course is designed for experienced GIS users who want to broaden their skill set with expertise in the ever-growing world of free and open source GIS. Participants are expected to have a technical background and an interest in developing comprehensive workflows using multiple software components. While we do not require any programming experience, we will be working on the command line and developing some small scripts. Participants should be eager to master these valuable skills.

This course is offered at Hunter College, CUNY, in the heart of the upper eastside of Manhattan very convenient to public transportation. [Click here][info] For course description, tuition, instructor bios and contacts, or call the Hunter Continuing Education office at 212-650-3850.
