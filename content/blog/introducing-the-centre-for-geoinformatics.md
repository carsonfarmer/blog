The new Centre for GeoInformatics (CGI) within the [School of Geography
and Geosciences][] and the [Department of Geography and Sustainable
Development][] is now an official university [Research Centre][] at the
[University of St Andrews][] in Scotland! A few months ago, I started my
new job as [Research Fellow][] with CGI, where I am continuing to work
with [Prof. A. Stewart Fotheringham][], who is the director of the new
centre, along with several new and continuing [PhD students][] and
[faculty members][]. Now that we have the centre officially up and
running, we are quickly getting ready for our [official launch][] next
month, as well as the launch of [our website][] (which is still 'in
development'). If you are interested in any aspect of GeoInformatics,
GIScience, Geocomputation, or spatial analysis, I strongly recommend you
check out our website to get a feel for what we are working on. We will
also be featuring a [research blog][], where we will post code, ideas,
thoughts, and results from our various research endeavours. Check it
out, and let us know what you think!
