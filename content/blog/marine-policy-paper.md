An article I worked on with [Dr Tim Stojanovic][1], "The development of
world oceans & coasts and concepts of sustainability", has recently been
[published online][2], with the journal [Marine Policy][3]. The article
can be cited as:

> Stojanovic T. & Farmer C. J. Q., (2013) The development of world oceans &
> coasts and concepts of sustainability. *Marine Policy* 42 157-165

I am particularly excited about this article because it marks
a major shift from any previous work that I've been involved with, and
is aimed directly at the world of policy - something I've been thinking
about for a while now. Additionally, the [data that we used][4] for this
paper provides enumerable avenues for further research and questions, so
hopefully this paper is the first in a series of collaborative works
with Dr. Stojanovic... stay tuned for more to come!

If you would like a copy of the paper but do not have access to the
article online, please [contact me][5] and I will forward you a PDF
