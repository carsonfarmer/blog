I have recently joined the editorial team at [Spatial Demography][spatial-demography]
-- a new journal outlet for demographers and others who use spatial data, 
methods, and theory. 

A bit more [about the journal][about]:
> Spatial Demography [ISSN: 2164-7070 (online)] focuses on the spatial analysis 
> of demographic processes. This cross-disciplinary work involves modern 
> demographic data visualization, enhanced geo-referenced data availability, and 
> spatial statistics, facilitated through full color graphics, motion video 
> tools, and a quick time-to-publication. The journal publishes research 
> articles, essays, research reports, data sources, computing software, teaching 
> notes, and book reviews on a wide range of topics of interest to the social 
> demographer.

Spatial Demography is more than just another new online journal - the editors 
strongly promote the use of the [forums][forums] as a place to engage with others on 
general research topics, as well as discuss specific articles from the journal 
and [Online First][online-first] area. One of the really nice thing about the forums 
is that they have a familiar 'blog-feel', where users are encourage to post 
their thoughts about the work being done by others as well as their own work. 

A big thanks to Frank Howell and Jeremy Porter (Editors-in-Chief) for inviting 
me on-board. I'm excited to see where this journal goes, and I hope *you'll* 
check it out as well.
