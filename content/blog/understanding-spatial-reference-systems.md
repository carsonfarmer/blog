For those of you who are still unclear about what exactly a spatial
reference system is, how it is used, and what it means for your data, I
found a pretty good quick guide to [spatial references, coordinate
systems, projections, datums and ellipsoids][]. This article was written
by Morten Nielsen (who works for ESRI), and it does a good job of
quickly and simply describing what makes up a spatial reference system,
and some of the errors that people make when talking about their spatial
data.

Having a good grasp of this stuff is important when working with spatial
data, so guides like the one above should really only be used as a quick
reference to more in-depth material covering these concepts. Check out
