Welcome to the new and improved `carsonfarmer.com`! If you are reading this, then
you are enjoying my new, repsonive static website/blog. The new site is powered 
by [Pelican][] -- a static website generator written in Python -- and is hosted

Here is a small note with some useful information that should be placed in the 'margins' of the website.

on [GitHub][github] using [GitHub Pages][gh-pages]. Most of the content on the site is written 
in Markdown, which makes it really easy to add headings, anchors, and all sorts
of goodies to simplify writing blog posts and web-pages.

The move from Wordpress to Pelican was relatively painless, though there were
some issues with comments and converting (some) existing posts to Markdown. I
also took the opportunity to update the site, change the page structure a bit
and try out a few things like adding icons, using Twitter Bootstrap for some of 
the UI, and some other tweaks. To get me though the process, I took advantage of
several blogs and sites dedicated to documenting Pelican:

* [Pelican documentation (which is great)][pelican-docs]
* [Creating A Pelican-Powered Site on GitHub Pages][magically-us]
* [Pelican Guide - Moving From WordPress and Initial Setup][pelican-guide]
* [Yes, this blog is now powered by Pelican][powered-by-pelican]

Once I get things working, I'll also start to think about some of the 
[points here], to make things even _more_ responsive and readable.

I am still missing some things that Wordpress did quite nicely, including
comments (I'm now relying on [Disqus][disqus] to handle comments on the site), 
site search, and the plethora of plugins and themes available for Wordpress 
sites. Having said that, I love writing posts using Markdown, I love that the 
site is static, fast (thanks )
