I'm sure everyone has seen this already, but I'm going to post it
anyway, as I think the more exposure open-source tools get, the better
off we'll all be!

Check out this [New York Times article][] which features `R`, the
open-source statistical programming language. `R` now has quite an
extensive range of [spatial analysis options][], and is the software of
choice for researchers using spatial statistics and geographic
information analysis.
