There's a discussion thread on the QGIS LinkedIn Group page about Python tutorials and resources. There were a few good suggestions, so I thought I'd share these with others. It starts with a *very* common question from a GIS (or any software that supports scripting) user:

> I'm a real 'end-user' of qgis and I want to improve my skills a little... I've found many python tutorials online but I don't know which are any good. Can anyone point me to some good resources?

The responses were useful, but not exhaustive:
