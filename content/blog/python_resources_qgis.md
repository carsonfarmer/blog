There's a discussion thread on the QGIS LinkedIn Group page about Python tutorials and resources. There were a few good suggestions, so I thought I'd share these with others. It starts with a *very* common question from a GIS (or any software that supports scripting) user:

> I'm a real 'end-user' of qgis and I want to improve my skills a little... I've found many python tutorials online but I don't know which are any good. Can anyone point me to some good resources?

The responses were useful, but not exhaustive:

* The PyQGIS Programmer's Guide: [http://locatepress.com/ppg]()
* PyQGIS developer cookbook: [http://www.qgis.org/en/docs/pyqgis_developer_cookbook/]()
* Geoprocessing with Python using FOSS GIS: [http://www.gis.usu.edu/~chrisg/python/2009/]()
* 10 Resources to Learn Python Programming Language: [http://codecondo.com/10-ways-to-learn-python/]()

Do you have another suggestion? Please sound off in the comments below!

[UPDATE]: I've added a link to resources for learning Python in general, very useful and comprehensive list. [Check it out](http://codecondo.com/10-ways-to-learn-python/)!
