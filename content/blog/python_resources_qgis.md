There's a discussion thread on the QGIS LinkedIn Group page about Python tutorials and resources. There were a few good suggestions, so I thought I'd share these with others. It starts with a *very* common question from a GIS (or any software that supports scripting) user:

> I'm a real 'end-user' of qgis and I want to improve my skills a little... I've found many python tutorials online but I don't know which are any good. Can anyone point me to some good resources?

The responses were useful, but not exhaustive:

<dl>
<dt>The PyQGIS Programmer's Guide</dt><dd>http://locatepress.com/ppg</dd>
<dt>PyQGIS developer cookbook</dt><dd> http://www.qgis.org/en/docs/pyqgis_developer_cookbook/</dd>
<dt>Geoprocessing with Python using FOSS GIS</dt><dd>http://www.gis.usu.edu/~chrisg/python/2009/</dd>
</dl>

Do you have another suggestion? Please sound off in the comments below!
