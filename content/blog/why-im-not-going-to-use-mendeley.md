Besides the obvious: "It's not open source!", I'm also not making the
switch from [Zotero][] to [Mendeley][] for my academic reference
management needs due to the answer to this question on the Mendeley FAQ
page:

> **Is Mendeley free?**
> 
> The straight answer would be yes and no. Yes, it's free, because:
> Everything you get when you sign up to Mendeley is completely free and
> will always remain free - including the features described in [What is
> Mendeley?][]
> 
> No, it's not *completely* free, because: At a later point in time, we
> will expand upon the existing features and introduce additional ones
> for professional users --- these will be available for a (very
> reasonable) fee.

It's also not *free* as in *freedom*...
