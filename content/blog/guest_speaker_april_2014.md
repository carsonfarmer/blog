Please join us **Wednesday, April 30th** from **3:30-5:00 pm** in the Hunter College Geography 
Conference Room (**Hunter North 1004**) for a talk by guest speakers JD Godchaux and Lela Prashad, and Robert Buchanan, who will be talking about *Free & Open Source Software for Geospatial Applications*.

If you can't make it in person, there will also be a [live feed available here][feed] (the feed will also be recorded, so you can view it at a later date as well).

**Announcement**:
We are excited to announce that the department will be hosting the second Free and Open Source for Geospatial (FOSS4G) presentation/discussion this Wednesday, from 3:30-5 pm in the Geography Department conference room (HN 1004).

The discussion will be on use of FOSS4G and web mapping technologies for community-based projects. Our theme is water quality and safety in the NYC region, and our guest speakers will be discussing two FOSS4G projects:

JD Godchaux and Lela Prashad from Nijel.org will discuss the [NY State Sewage Project][sewage] which monitors sewage overflows in public waterways throughout the state.

Robert Buchanan from the New School will discuss a [separate project][water-2] on water quality mapping in the New York metropolitan region using volunteer data collection efforts and Google maps.

Both tools have been employed by the NY Surfriders Foundation chapter as ways to monitor overall water quality and respond to deficiencies in government efforts to ensure clean and safe water for humans and other species to enjoy.

We hope you join us if you have time, it should be a great discussion on the ways you can employ easy to use FOSS4G tools to support community service and non-profit causes of all kinds. Stay tuned for the flyer!

For any questions, contact [Gene via email](mailto: erichte@hunter.cuny.edu).


Hope to see you there!
