OpenStreetMap (OSM) is a project designed to create and provide free
spatial data (street maps) to anyone and everyone who wants them. It is
based on an open-source [philosophy][], and combines wiki-like user
generated data, with [free access][], allowing users to create, edit,
download, and use OSM data to their hearts content. According to the
[OSM website][], "the project was started because most maps you think of
as free actually have legal or technical restrictions on their use,
holding back people from using them in creative, productive or
unexpected ways." There are now tones of websites and open-source
software projects that incorporate OSM data, and the growing popularity
of the site means that the data is only going to get better (more
accurate) and bigger (more data).

Essentially, OpenStreetMap contributors go out into the world
with handheld GPS units, and an insatiable need to map everything around
them. They track their own movements down streets and trails, and along
the way they record street names, parks, towns, cities, and other points
of interest (POIs). All these GPS tracks can be uploaded into the OSM
database, along with place names, street names, and any other pertinent
information (type of road, and/or road intersections). All the while,
others can do the same thing, in the same area, adjusting the same data,
making more and more accurate maps of the region.

If all this free data isn't enough, OSM also processes the uploaded
data, and produces detailed street-level maps which are freely available
for publishing on websites. If fact, in 5 simple steps, you too can have
a beautiful OSM powered map on your website.

### How to put an OpenStreetMap on your own site

1. Browse the OpenStreetMap and find the area you want to map, using
   the zoom tools to zoom right in to your area of interest.
2. Select the export tab.
3. When choosing the export format, select "Embeddable HTML".
4. If you want, pop in a marker symbol so everyone knows where to look...
5. Copy the provided HTML code, and paste into your site wherever you want the map to show up.

For an example, check out [my contact page][]. As you can see, <strike>there
aren't a lot of people collecting data in Maynooth...</strike>, recent work in
Maynooth has created an extremely rich, usable, and downright decent map
of Maynooth. Nice work Blazej Ciepluch!
