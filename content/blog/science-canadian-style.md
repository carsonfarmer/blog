Recently, a [colleague of mine][] from Wilfred Laurier University has
started a website with some colleagues called RinkWatch
([http://rinkwatch.org/][]). The website is designed to track
climate-change by keeping tabs on local community ice rink(s). This
innovative use of [Citizen Science][] is getting quite a bit of buzz up
in Canada, but the idea has implications for any country with a culture
of outdoor skating rinks. It is also a great way to get the public
involved in the climate debate, and science in general! RinkWatch
received a mention in the Canadian Association of Geographers' Mailing
list, which I'm posting here to help spread the good word. You can also
check out the [full story and video here][].

> The site, created by a
> group of geographers at Wilfred Laurier University, invites people to
> register online and record the state of their homemade ice surfaces.
> Researchers will use the data - when the flooding is done, how many
> weeks the ice is useable - to track the progression of climate change.
> According to Robert McLeman, one of the project's creators, it's also a
> chance to educate Canadians about the real-world implications of climate
> change, an issue that can seem abstract when discussed on TV or in the
> classroom. "People appreciate the scale of the problem, but don't
> understand personally how it fits in with their life," McLeman, an
> associate professor of geography and environmental science, told CBC
> Hamilton. "We thought this sort of provides an opportunity to connect
> people to environmental research literally through their own backyards."
> He said the website, which has already registered 375 rinks across
> Canada and the northern U.S., has spawned some unintended, but very
> welcome uses. Participants, he said, are sharing ice-making tips with
> each other, creating a richer, more interactive online community than
> he'd anticipated. "People who are coming to it really just are
> passionate."
