Please join us **Wednesday, May 21st** from **4:00-6:00 pm** in the Hunter College Geography 
Conference Room (**Hunter North 1004**) for a talk by guest speaker Stephen Flood, who will be talking about *Communicating across disciplines in the climate change sphere*.

If you can't make it in person, there will also be a [live feed available here][feed] (the feed will also be recorded, so you can view it at a later date as well).

**Topic**: This seminar will leverage the work carried out in the Climate Changes Impacts and Implications for New Zealand (CCII) project to demonstrate some of the key issues and approaches associated with communicating across a diverse range of disciplines and stakeholders. The broad aim of the presentation is to provide the epistemic community within the climate change sphere with grounded examples of effective communication approaches while also pointing out potential pitfalls and how best to avoid them.

**Bio**: Dr. Stephen Flood is a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at the Climate Change Research Institute (CCRI) in Victoria University of Wellington, New Zealand. His research is focused on climate change adaptation, communication and decision-making associated with the interdisciplinary Climate Changes Implications and Impacts (CCII) project. Dr. Flood is also a lead consultant with SmartEarth consulting, which works with Governments and civil society in least developed countries (LDCs) to secure the necessary funding for capacity building and institutional development in the sphere of climate change mitigation and adaptation.

Stephen is also a former colleague of mine from the [National University of Ireland Maynooth][nuim], where he worked at the [Irish Climate Analysis and Research Units (ICARUS)][icarus].
