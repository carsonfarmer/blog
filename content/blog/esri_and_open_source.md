[![ESRI & Open Source][image]{.right}][blog-post]

Here's a [blog post from ESRI][blog-post] about ESRI's transition to open source, open development, and social coding.[*](#kessler) It features [GitHub][github] pretty prominently, which continues to be an awesome resource for collaborative work -- and not just for code. My colleagues and I have started using it for planning meetings and workshops, developing research papers, maintaining websites (this site is hosted on GitHub), and yes, even open source software projects. ESRI obviously also thinks GitHub is a useful resource, and their keynote for the [ESRI DevSummit][dev-summit] is [GitHub CEO and Co-Founder Chris Wanstrath][chris]!

Here's a particularly nice snippet from the post:
   
> The value is clear: through active and public collaboration we can effectively deliver a platform that empowers anyone with the freedom and ownership to customize solutions to their own domain. Our community spans the entire domain of government, science, education, commercial, and industrial practice. As a company it would be impossible for us to effectively serve every users need. Instead, open-source enables the community to scale itself.
