Special session titled "Geocomputational landscapes and spaces" at the
[International Conference on Applied Mathematics, Modeling and
Computational Science][ammcs] (AMMCS-2013), to be held at [Wilfrid Laurier
University][wilfrid], August 26-30, 2013.

The deadline for abstracts is **April 15, 2013**.

Description of the session:

> This session focuses on new applications and theoretical developments
> in geocomputation. Increasingly, spatial analysis and modelling
> requires advanced computational techniques (MCMC, INLA, GAs etc.) to
> address problems related to land and resource management. This session
> is devoted to current developments and advances in geocomputation for
> understanding landscape patterns, processes, and building spatial
> decision-support systems. For example, talks will explore
> computational solutions to problems related to multi-objective
> optimization of spatial configuration of land-uses, new computational
> approaches to spatial model development and assessment and map
> comparison analysis. We encourage submissions of additional
> presentations related to geocomputation including spatial modelling,
> genetic algorithm development, spatial databases, spatial
> representation, visualization, and spatial analysis of 'Big Data'.
