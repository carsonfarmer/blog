![GEOS Seminar Series Announcement]({filename}/images/GEOS-Oct-2-Ahearn-Farmer.jpg)

The Geography, Earth Science and Oceanography Seminars (GEOS) is hosting myself and Prof Sean Ahearn this Thursday to give a talk on "Computational GIScience: Current Research at the CARSI Lab". The talk will feature a bunch of the fun and exciting stuff we're doing at CARSI, including our EnviroCar project and some of my recent work with spatial data flows. The talks will start around 5:30 PM on Thursday October 2nd 2014 in the Science Center, Room 4102 at the CUNY Graduate Center (365 5th Avenue, NYC). I'm told that light snacks and refreshments will be served, so if anything, it's a chance to get some free grub!

Here's a link to the [original flyer]({filename}/uploads/GEOS-Oct-2.pdf). If you can't make it but want to hear about what CARSI is up to these days, [drop me a line](mailto:carson.farmer@hunter.cuny.edu).
