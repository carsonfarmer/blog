> The Journal of Spatial Information Science (JOSIS) is an
> international, interdisciplinary, open-access journal dedicated to
> publishing high-quality, original research articles in spatial
> information science. The journal aims to publish research spanning the
> theoretical foundations of spatial and geographical information
> science, through computation with geospatial information, to
> technologies for geographical information use.
>
> JOSIS is run as a service to the geographic information science
> community, supported entirely through the efforts of volunteers. JOSIS
> does not aim to profit from the articles published in the journal,
> which are open access.

Since it's run entirely by volunteers, they provide a link to [become
involved][] as a reader, reviewer, or author.

Thanks to [Professor Chris Brunsdon][] for the heads-up!
