This tutorial marks the 4th release from a [series of tutorials] on using Python for introductory statistical analysis. This time around, I cover the difference between "grand" and "group-wise" statistics, and (towards the end of the tutorial), we'll even look at some very simple models of grouped data. As always, the notebook for this tutorial is [available here][notebooks].
