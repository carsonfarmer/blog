I recently came across two extremely cool videos while preparing lectures for my
transportation geography course. It is pretty cool to see the development of the 
regions around the transportation network while the network itself remains 
pretty much unchanged. Worth a quick watch!

The first video depicts the London to Brighton Train Journey for three time 
periods. In 1953, the BBC made a point-of-view film from a London to Brighton 
train, 30 years later (1983) they did the same trip again, and again 
30 years after that (2013).

The second video is from the Vancouver SkyTrain, with older footage (1985) from 
BCRTC/Translink, and newer footage (2013) by Celgen Studios. You can get the 
original Translink footage [from here][].
