In my [last post][], I implemented several classification algorithms for
quantitative data which could be used directly from the Python console
in QGIS. While this was a handy addition to my PyQGIS toolkit, it wasn't
quite handy enough for me, so I decided to (re)implement the same
algorithms in C++ so that they could be added directly to the QGIS API.
Before I did that however, I wanted to fix a few issues, and speed
things up a bit, particularly for the Jenks Natural Breaks algorithm,
which can be quite slow for large datasets.

After porting everything over to C++, I noticed that things were still
a little too slow for large datasets. My first thought was to limit the
amount of data that the algorithm had to go through by taking a random
sample (without replacement) and only running the algorithm on this
sample. Based on trial and error, I found that about 1000 values was a
good number to use, as it was still relatively fast, but generally not
too small to be unrepresentative of the overall distribution. In the
end, I went with using `max(1000, n*0.10)` for layers with more than
1000 features.

Since several of my colleagues here still use ESRI products, I also
decided to compare my version with the Natural Breaks algorithm in
ArcMAP. I noticed right away that their version was much faster (when I
didn't use the random sampling scheme), so I decided to search around
for information on their implementation. Obviously ESRIâ€™s documentation
didn't explain the specifics of their algorithm, but it does produce
very similar class breaks to mine (and the implementation [available in
R](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/classInt/index.html), 
so I was relatively confident that the main underlying algorithm
was similar. I then stumbled upon this question in an 
[ESRI forum][]:

The initial response was quite good, but unfortunately, like all
propriety software companies, when asked exactly how the algorithm was
implemented, they responded with:

Bummer... I *was* able to figure out a few things from simply clicking
around the various different options in ArcMAP, and I found that for
large datasets, ArcMAP's version of the Jenks algorithm also uses
sampling to reduce computation time. However, I was surprised to find
that their sampling technique appears to simply sample the first `x`
data values (where `x` defaults to 10,000, but can be changed by the
user). Depending on how the data was created/digitised, this may not
produce a statistically representative sample at all! In my opinion, it
is better to use a random sampling scheme, with the constraint that both
the minimum and maximum values are included in the random sample so that
we don't lose values off the ends of our class intervals. Which is
exactly what I've done...

At the moment I'm still looking at ways to optimize my rather basic
implementation. So far I use a relatively simple sampling procedure, but
it might be possible to do something more 'intelligent' here to speed
things up while maintaining a statistically representative sample.
Comments are more than welcome. I have also posted the diff file to the
QGIS developers mailing list for evaluation, and once I tidy up a few
issues I'll commit to this trunk, making it available for future
versions of QGIS.

Just to remind you of how important it is to carefully consider the
classification scheme you use when presenting your data, here is a
graphic of the 5 different classification schemes (soon to be) available
in QGIS. All 5 methods are grouping the same underlying data (2007
population) into the same number of classes (5).
