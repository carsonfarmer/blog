In case you missed [Eric Brelsford's][twitter] talk last Wednesday on *Free & Open Source Software for Geospatial Applications*, I've embedded the recording below for your viewing pleasure (Eric's slides are [also available][slides]). This is the first in a series of talks organized within the department of [Geography][geog] at [Hunter College][hunter], CUNY around GIS and Technology (we're calling them GTECH Experiments). Each talk is organized by a student (thanks go to [Mara Gittleman][mara] this time), and features a member of the wider geo-technology community. Stayed tuned for news and events around GTECH Experiments in the future! For now, check out the video below:
