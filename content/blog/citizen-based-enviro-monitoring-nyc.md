Last fall, Carsten Kessler and I gave a online talk about our [EnviroCar project](https://envirocar.org).
The talk was entitled "EnviroCar - A GIS Framework for Citizen-based Environmental Monitoring in NYC"
and was hosted by the [New York State GIS Association](http://www.nysgis.net). It was the first talk of
the Transportation Professional Affiliation Group, which was quite an honor for Carsten and I. Check out
the NYSGIS [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/NYSGISA) for more awesome talks, and check out 
the following embedded video to see the EnviroCar recording:

> EnviroCar is a citizen science platform that utilizes GPS and automobile sensors to collect data 
> on driving behavior. Speed, fuel consumption and CO2 emissions are recorded, anonymized and then
> shared to EnviroCarâ€™s cloud service for analysis by scientists and planners.

> Data from multiple users collected over time paint a detailed picture of traffic conditions in a
> city. Areas of high emissions, traffic jams, or other traffic flow issues can be identified. Thus
> the data can both inform traffic planning and augment emission data captured by stationary sensors.
> All software and data components of EnviroCar are open source and the data are available in various
> formats for mapping and analysis. Originally developed in Germany, CARSI is investigating the
> potential of expanding EnviroCar to New York City.
