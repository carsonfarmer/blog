Last fall, [Carsten Kessler](http://carsten.io/) and I gave a online talk about our [EnviroCar project](https://envirocar.org).
The talk was entitled "EnviroCar - A GIS Framework for Citizen-based Environmental Monitoring in NYC"
and was hosted by the [New York State GIS Association](http://www.nysgis.net). It was the first talk of
the Transportation Professional Affiliation Group, which was quite an honor for Carsten and I. Check out
the NYSGIS [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/NYSGISA) for more awesome talks, and check out 
the following embedded video to see the EnviroCar recording:
