An article I worked on with [Lex Comber][] and [Chris Brunsdon][],
"Community detection in spatial networks: Inferring land use from a
planar graph of land cover objects", has recently been [published
on-line][], with the [International Journal of Applied Earth Observation
and Geoinformation][ijaeog]. The article can be cited as:

> detection in spatial networks: Inferring land use from a planar graph
> of land cover objects. *International Journal of Applied Earth
> Observation and Geoinformation*, 18: 274â€“282
