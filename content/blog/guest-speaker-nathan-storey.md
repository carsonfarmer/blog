[Nathan Storey][nathan] will be speaking to my spatial data analysis class 
later today, October 10th, 2013, and you are invited to attend! Nathan is a 
former [Hunter Urban Affairs][uap] student and current Open Data Guru working 
with [Ontodia][ontodia] doing GIS/open data projects for NYC. Check out 
[PediaCities][pediacities], their platform to curate, organize, and link data 
about cities.

This will be a great opportunity to see GIS data applied to real-world problem 
sets here in NYC. The discussion will go approx 1 hour, beginning at 5:35 in 
the large lab of Hunter College, CUNY, North Building, Room 1090B.  Due to the 
location, no refreshments will be served, but its a good opportunity to feed 
your brain :)

Here is what Nathan (the speaker) has to say about this talk:

    I will be speaking to Carson Farmer's spatial data analysis class next week 
    about open data in NYC, data discovery, and [PediaCities][pediacities], a 
    data encyclopedia project I've been working on for the past 6 months.
