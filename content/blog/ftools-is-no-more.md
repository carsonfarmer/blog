I recently decided to drop `ftools.ca`, since I hadn't updated it in a very long 
time, and it was really just costing me money to keep a 'dead' website up and 
running. Additionally, with the new QGIS [plugin infrastructure][qgis-plugins], 
hosting my own plugins (the website's primary purpose) was no longer needed. 
The site has served me well for many years, and really helped get fTools (the 
plugin) into the QGIS core codebase. The website has served its purpose, and 
now that I have very little involvement with fTools and the QGIS Processing 
Toolbox that is poised to replace it, I'm moving on: `ftools.ca` is dead, long 
live `ftools.ca`!

However, now that [QGIS 2.0][qgis-two] has rolled out, it seems that at least 
one part of ftools.ca is missed: my old cartogram plugin. If I 
have some spare time, I'll try to update the plugin to the latest and 
greatest [QGIS 2.0 standards][plugin-dev] and upload it to the new QGIS plugins 
system. In the mean time, for those out there who would like to use it right 
away, you can get the [original code from here][original-code] or [grab it from 
github][github-repo]. In fact, if someone is able and willing, they can grab 
the code from github, update it for QGIS 2.0, and submit a pull request which I 
will (more than likely) happily accept.
