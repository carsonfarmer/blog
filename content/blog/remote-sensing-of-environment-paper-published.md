My latest article, "Identification of snow cover regimes through spatial
and temporal clustering of satellite microwave brightness temperatures",
has recently been [published on-line][], with the journal[Remote Sensing
of Environment][]. <strike>For now,</strike>
UPDATE: The article can be cited as:

> Farmer, C. J. Q., Nelson, T. A., Wulder, M.A. and Derksen, C. (2010).
> Identiﬁcation of snow cover regimes through spatial and temporal
> clustering of satellite microwave brightness temperatures, *Remote
> Sensing of Environment*, 114 (1): 199-210.

If you would like a copy, but do not have access to the article, please
email me and I can forward you a PDF version.
