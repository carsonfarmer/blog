Over the past few weeks, I've been following a really great blog by
[Carl Vogel][]. This blog has an excellent (growing) collection of
Python examples based on porting code and examples from R to Python. In
general, it is useful for those "interested in the Python data analysis
toolkit and its viability as an alternative to R". Carl draws on
examples from *[Machine Learning for Hackers][]* by [Drew Conway][] and
[John Miles White][], as well as [Gelman][] and [Hill’s][] *[Data
Analysis Using Regression and Multilevel/Hierarchical Models][]*.

From the blog:

> The objective [of this blog] isn’t to just make a key that translates
> functions and methods in R into Python equivalents. Instead, the goal
> is to reproduce the results and insights of the analysis in idiomatic
> Python [...] Sometimes there will be a direct translation from a line
> of R to a line of Python; other times Python will suggest an
> altogether different approach to the problem.

To make things even more useful for us, Carl has made the code,
examples, and [IPython][] notebooks available in his [Github repo][],
which makes it really easy to work through the examples. He's also open
to requests/suggestions, so if you have a good R resource you'd like to
see ported to Python, maybe give him a shout?

As an extra bonus, I suggest you check out Blendtec's hilarious ["Will
it blend?"][] ad campaign, from which Carl derived his "Will in Python"
name and logo...

Happy coding!
