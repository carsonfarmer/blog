This is just a quick note about a great opportunity for early career researchers 
interested in the field of [geoinformatics]. The [Centre for GeoInformatics][center] at the
[University of St Andrews][st-andrews] in Scotland has two new early career researcher positions
available to start right away. These are really great opportunities for someone
in the first 4-years (full-time equivalent) of their research careers who has not 
yet have been awarded a doctoral degree. This is also especially good for foreign
students, as the [Marie Curie][marie-curie] regulations require that candidates must not have 
resided or carried out his/her main activity in the UK for more than 12 months 
in the past 3 years.
