I am giving a talk and chairing a session at the [Canadian Association
of Geographers (CAG) Annual Meeting][] this week in Waterloo, Ontario,
Canada. My session, entitled "Spatial Modelling", is [scheduled][] for
Thursday at 08:30, and is supported by the CAG GIS Study Group. If you
are in the neighbourhood, check out the session, and stick around for my
talk: "Spatial interaction modelling of commuting flows within local
labour markets", which is also [available online][] (best viewed at 90%
on full screen).

Hope I see you there!
