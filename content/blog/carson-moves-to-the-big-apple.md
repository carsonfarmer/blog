I am very excited to announce that I will soon be moving to New York to
take up a faculty position in the [Department of Geography][] at [Hunter
College][] of the [City University of New York][]. The plans have been
in motion for quite a while, and now that my wife and I have started to
pack up our stuff, I thought I'd post something here to make it
'official'. I start full time in NY at the end of January, at which
point I will be diving head first into teaching and research. I am
really looking forward to engaging with the active NY open source
community, teaching a whole slew of new courses, interacting more
directly with students, and working with my new colleagues on all sorts
of cool research projects.

With that in mind, I will also be sad to leave [St
Andrews][]. The past year working in the [School of Geography and
Geosciences][] has been a great experience; I've learned a lot about the
inner workings of a research centre by helping to set up the [Centre for
GeoInformatics][] and I've made a lot of great personal and professional
connections. Combined, the past four years in Ireland and the UK have
been very exciting, and I have had excellent opportunities to make
friends, build collaborative networks, hone my research skills, carve
out my own research niche, and develop a longer-term research program
that should keep me busy for years to come!

I'll try to continue posting the occasional blog post over the next few
months, and hopefully compile a decent record of my progression from
postdoc to professor (lecturer to my EU friends) along the way. In the
mean time, feel free to [get in touch][] with me if you are ever in the
NY area!
