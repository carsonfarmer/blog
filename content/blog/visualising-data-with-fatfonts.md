I recently posted an [article on the CGI blog][] about some
Visualizations that I produced with researchers from [St Andrews'
Computer Human Interaction Research Group (SACHI)][] using [FatFonts][],
a tpographic Visualization technique developed by SACHI co-founder
[Miguel Nacenta][] and colleagues ([Uta Hinrichs][], and [Sheelagh
Carpendale][]).
The initial Visualizations are now on-line, and feature flow matrices for 
[English internal migration][] and [commuting between Irish local labour markets][]. We
have also produced several inforgraphics based on global oceans data
that [Dr Timothy Stojanovic][] and I are working with as part of
Tim's work linking off-shore cumulative human impacts to
on-shore terrestrial urbanization (more on these graphics soon). I'm
still experimenting with FatFonts at this stage, but so far, I'm quite
pleased with the results, and find that they offer a nice way to add
beauty to my potentially boring data!
