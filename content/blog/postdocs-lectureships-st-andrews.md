I've just recently moved on from the CGI and St Andrews and I
can tell you that it is a great place to work! The people are fun to
work with, there are plenty of opportunities for collaborations and
cross-disciplinary research, there are funding opportunities for
geoinformatics research in the UK and EU right now, and you simply can't
beat the setting - St Andrews is a beautiful coastal town on the East
Coast of Scotland. If you are interested in any of the above positions,
don't hesitate to contact the CGI. Additionally, the CGI would greatly
appreciate if you could please forward this message to any potential
candidates. You can find more information about the above positions,
plus other [exciting opportunities at CGI][opportunities].
