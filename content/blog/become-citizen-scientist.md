## Do you have an Android phone? Do you use a car on a regular basis?

# Become a Citizen Scientist!

enviroCar is an open platform to collect and analyze moving vehicle data. It accesses the carâ€™s sensors with an Android smartphone and a Bluetooth OBD-II adapter that we will provide for free. The enviroCar app provides you with information about your car and your driving characteristics. By uploading the data to the enviroCar server you contribute to a growing collection of anonymized open data, helping scientists and traffic experts understand our city. We are looking for volunteers to join the envircoCar community in NYC and help us learn more about traffic flows and emissions.

Sound exciting? Contact [myself](mailto:carson.farmer@hunter.cuny.edu) or [Carsten Kessler](mailto:carsten.kessler@hunter.cuny.edu) to get your **free** OBD-II adapter and become a citizen scientist!
