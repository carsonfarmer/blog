Two quicks notes to share:

Firstly, please check out this [excellent introduction to GIS][] by Tim
Sutton, Otto Dassau, and Marcelle Sutton in partnership with the Chief
Directorate for Spatial Planning & Information, Department of Land
Affairs, Eastern Cape, South Africa, and the Spatial Information
Management Unit, Office of the Premier, Eastern Cape, South Africa. They
use QGIS to present some basic GIS concepts and skills, and I
particularly like their section on Coordinate Reference Systems.

Secondly, don't forget to checkout the [FOSS4G 2009 Free and open source
software for geospatial][] conference in Sydney in October. There will
be loads of excellent presentations and exhibitors, and the atmosphere
is always very cool. I will be presenting [some software][] that I've
been developing for a while now, and will hopefully get a chance to
represent [QGIS][] there as well!
