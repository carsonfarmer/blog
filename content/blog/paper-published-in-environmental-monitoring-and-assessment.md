An article I worked on with Margaret E. Andrew, Trisalyn A. Nelson,
Michael A. Wulder, George W. Hobart, and Nicholas C. Coops, "Ecosystem
classifications based on summer and winter conditions", has recently
been [published on-line][], with [Environmental Monitoring and
Assessment][emaa]. For now, the article can be cited as:
