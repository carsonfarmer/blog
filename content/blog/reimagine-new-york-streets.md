Here's a [TED talk][talk] from Janette Sadik-Khan, the New York City Transportation 
Commissioner, on how they've transformed New York City streets over the past 
several years.

I love the [Citi Bike][citibike] program (especially the data), which she 
helped introduce, so it is interesting to hear her talk about how and why the 
program was started. There is also an interesting article on Sadik-Khan on the 
TED [blog][blog] which provides some additional insight into her and the various 
programs she's helped develop.
